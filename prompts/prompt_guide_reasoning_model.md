Understood. I will compare your provided prompt against state-of-the-art prompts specifically designed for data analysis and financial/business analysis. I will research and find relevant examples of state-of-the-art prompts tackling the same purpose, and then evaluate how your prompt compares to them. I will provide the results once I've completed the research.

Here is a comparison of your existing prompt with leading prompts and current best‑practice guidelines for analytical AI tasks.

### Evidence from state‑of‑the‑art prompts & guidelines

- **Data‑analyst prompts** – The widely‑shared “Expert Data Analyst” system prompt instructs the model to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify key trends and anomalies, generate actionable insights, recommend strategies, and design intuitive dashboards. It tells the model to produce a detailed report summarising findings, recommendations, dashboard design and any code used.
- **Reasoning‑model guidelines** – Recent guidance for “thinking” models like OpenAI’s o‑series advises **minimal prompting**. The model should be given concise, direct instructions and allowed to figure out intermediate steps itself; too much information or step‑by‑step instructions can reduce accuracy. The guide also warns that few‑shot and chain‑of‑thought prompts (where you provide examples or ask the model to reason step‑by‑step) can degrade performance, and that more context isn’t always better. Using delimiters to separate parts of the input is recommended when structured outputs are needed. For complex tasks, encouraging the model to take extra reasoning time improves accuracy.

| **Your prompt**                            | Extremely detailed system message; defines role, principles (accuracy, skepticism, clarity, elegance), a four‑phase SOP (plan, execute, audit, synthesize), rigorous data cleaning & granularity checks, explicit formula derivations, robust numeric parsing, error handling, self‑correction, structured output. | **Strengths:** encourages meticulous data cleaning, transparency, reproducibility, and self‑audit; suitable for complex financial analyses. **Weaknesses:** very long and prescriptive; uses chain‑of‑thought style and multi‑step instructions; may overwhelm modern “thinking” models that perform better with concise prompts; heavy step‑by‑step guidance conflicts with best‑practice recommendations to avoid few‑shot/CoT prompts; high cognitive load may reduce output quality. |
| **“Expert Data Analyst” prompt (DocsBot)** | Asks the model to act as a data‑analysis expert: perform EDA, detect patterns and anomalies, generate insights, recommend actions, build dashboards, and review outputs. Specifies a clear report format.                                                                                                          | **Strengths:** concise and focused; covers analysis, insights and visualization; asks for step‑by‑step reasoning only at high level; produces business‑ready output. **Weaknesses:** lacks robust data‑cleaning and error‑handling instructions; doesn’t address complex cross‑dataset or financial metrics; may not ensure reproducibility or data‑integrity checks.                                                                                                                    |
| **Reasoning‑model guidelines (Helicone)**  | Advocates minimal prompting, letting the model reason internally. Warns against few‑shot and chain‑of‑thought prompts and suggests using delimiters for structured outputs. Encourages more reasoning time for complex tasks.                                                                                      | **Strengths:** aligned with latest research on models like OpenAI o‑series; promotes higher accuracy by avoiding overloaded prompts and unnecessary context. **Weaknesses:** light on domain‑specific guidance; not tailored to data or financial analysis; may require additional content to enforce data cleaning or metric definitions.                                                                                                                                               |

### Recommendations

1. **Condense instructions.** Current reasoning models work better when prompts are concise. Keep role and high‑level objectives, but move lengthy SOP details into a secondary resource or attach them as separate guidelines rather than embedding everything in the prompt.
2. **Avoid explicit chain‑of‑thought.** Remove phrases like “verbalize your plan” and detailed step‑by‑step instructions. Instead, instruct the model to “plan internally” and present the final logic and results. This follows the advice to avoid CoT prompting and encourages the model to reason autonomously.
3. **Use delimiters and modular sections.** If structured outputs (e.g., JSON files, reports) are required, mark them with clear delimiters (e.g., `[PLAN]…[/PLAN]`, `[CODE]…[/CODE]`). This helps the model interpret each section correctly and simplifies parsing downstream.
4. **Retain essential data integrity checks.** Your instructions on semantic aggregation (transaction vs. snapshot), mixed‑granularity detection, and robust numeric parsing are valuable for financial analysis. Preserve these elements but summarise them succinctly.
5. **Encourage internal verification, not exhaustive narration.** Instead of instructing the model to audit and rewrite its entire process, ask it to “ensure the result is plausible and consistent with the data; if inconsistencies arise, re‑evaluate calculations.” This prompts self‑correction without long, explicit loops.

Your prompt is thorough and disciplined, suitable for older models that benefit from explicit structure. However, to align with current state‑of‑the‑art prompts and reasoning‑model best practices, distill it to the critical business rules, data‑cleaning directives and output requirements, and trust the model to handle the internal reasoning.
